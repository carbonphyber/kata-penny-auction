# Penny Auction

A small exercise in programming to support a [penny auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_fee_auction) website engine.

This is not intended to be an actual website, only a [code kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_%28programming%29).

## Environment

Intended to run in Python3. Developed on a late version of Mac OS X.

## Testing

To run unit tests:

```
cd server
python -m unittest test
```
